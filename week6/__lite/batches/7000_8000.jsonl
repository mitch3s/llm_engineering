Its excellent original design needed only a few minor tweaks and improvements over the years to keep up with the demands of modern PC hardware. An important equation in keeping the TJ04 a popular choice among system builders was its understated and classic styling. So in designing the TJ04-E (Evolution), SilverStone engineers kept the exterior styling largely unchanged while vastly improving the internals. The power supply is now bottom-mounted with the ability to accommodate up to four 5.25\" drives, nine 3.5\" hard drives and six SSDs, raising the bar significantly for storage capacity in a mid tower format. In addition to increased storage capacity, the TJ04-E can also install cards up to 17 inches without the need to remove any hard drive cage, a feat usually accomplished in full towers. To make sure the myriad of component can operate effectively, the TJ04-E includes a custom cooling solution to reduce hard drive temperatures and two custom cables with built-in capacitors to facilitate cable management and improve drive stability. To finish up TJ04-E\\'s already impressive layout efficiency, design details borrowed from other great SilverStone products such as positive pressure and quick removable filters will enable users to easily maintain consistently high performance for years to come.

It is heated to produce calcium oxide, then aged in water. Finally, the lime is blended with marble and other mineral aggregates. Applied in multiple layers, which are then burnished to create a smooth surface with the illusion of depth and texture. When applied correctly, this type of plaster will create a highly polished and marble-like finish.', 'THE  : Many of the so-called Venetian plasters used today are synthetic plasters made by paint manufacturers OR thick paint. They are designed to emulate the look of authentic plasters without any of the benefits. Our plasters, and all their ingredients, are harvested and manufactured in a small region in Northern Italy. This gives you a truly authentic and high-quality product. Our plasters come ready to be applied to your walls in the colors that you choose', ' OF  : Authentic lime plaster, made with the highest quality of ingredients, will age gracefully, and will be an excellent sound barrier and insulator. It will also reduce the amount of humidity in a room by absorbing moisture, which then evaporates off the surface over time. Easy to maintain and keep clean.', 'GREEN  : FirmoLux is an all-natural, Green building product with 0-VOC\u2019s, and LEED point qualified. Our Venetian plasters are environmentally friendly, biodegradable, and non-toxic. Unlike synthetic or acrylic plasters, authentic lime plasters stay clean on the surface and inside the walls. Lime plaster keeps a healthy indoor living environment.', 'TRUST : FirmoLux is an international distribution company with its roots in Italy. The plasters they import have been in production for centuries in the Veneto region of Northern Italy. FirmoLux has been distributing these fine plasters in North America for almost 15 years.

In his spare time, he tries to figure out how to make woodworking faster, easier and more enjoyable. Several years ago, he inspired us to come up with the ideal woodworker\u2019s pocket rule. A simple add-on rule-stop and thoughtful calibration layout make these the perfect fit for your apron pocket. When you need vertical measurement, slide the stop off the end and insert it into the cut-out on the blade. Now your rule has a perfect stand to keep it upright while you use both hands to dial in the height of a router bit, saw blade or dado stack, matching it to the easy-to-read scale engraved on the end of the rule. Easy-to-Use calibration designs. The inch model has 1/16\" and 1/32\" scales on both sides. They\u2019re lined up so if you need the finer scale, you just flip the rule over and you\u2019re there. Same thing for the end scale, just flip it over to look at finer or coarser graduations. It\u2019s a welcome feature if your shop lighting isn\u2019t perfect or if your eyesight isn\u2019t what it used to be. Made from stainless steel this is our most durable version. Milled to a precise 1-inch width. The stainless model is 1/16\" thick. You\u2019ll love the clean, precise look of our state-of-the-art laser engraving, as will generations of woodworkers to come. To keep your Paolini Pocket Rules handy, we offer the Paolini Pocket Rule Rack-It.

Emit 10 is a compact two-way stand-mount speaker that uses technology derived from Dynaudio's ultra-high-end Confidence Contour i and Evoke series. It's the ideal model for smaller rooms and satellite channels in a home cinema system. Designed and engineered at Dynaudio Labs in Denmark Emit 10 has been developed and tuned by the same minds behind their award-winning high-end families - right down to the smallest detail. Under the hood you'll find a 14cm MSP (Magnesium Silicate Polymer) mid-bass unit. MSP is a material Dynaudio developed themselves and has been using for decades. It provides exactly the right combination of lightness stiffness and damping for super-fine control without loss of power - essential when a driver is reproducing both low-bass and crucial midrange frequencies. Legendary Engineering Emit 10's mid/bass driver is derived from the Esotec+ in the successful Evoke series. Its double magnet system gives better movement control and sensitivity which means you'll hear improved frequency response and dynamics at lower frequencies while retaining crystal-clear midrange performance. That means you'll hear what you want from a powerful rhythm section plus guitars vocals and more - all without distortion at louder volumes. You'll notice that the dust cap isn't simply glued on. It's part of the playing surface of the cone. The little dashed line around the edge - the balance rib structure - is bonded directly to the 38mm voice coil behind it. It's an incredibly strong connection with the motor which means more of the coil's motion energy is transferred to the diaphragm. Behind the cone The voice-coil itself is made of copper-clad aluminum wire. Aluminum is light which gives the driver a fleetness of foot you might not find elsewhere while the copper coating increases conductivity for more power. It's a winning combination of detail and punch.
