Featuring a stylish white face and a large bright-blue display with white text provides high contrast and has a wide viewing angle for easy reading from just about anywhere in your room and leaves such a small footprint it will leave you with the impression of quality. The clock starts by connecting to the atomic clock in Boulder, Colorado to set the most accurate time keeping technology currently available. Once the signal is found it will synchronize every hour to ensure that it is the right time, all the time. Once the clock is set you can program the dual alarms to wake to your favorite AM or FM station or take advantage of the Humane Waking System that begins with a low volume beep and gradually increases in intensity to slowly wake you instead of receiving a firm jolt that others provide. With its intuitive design you have the ability to select the days of the week you wish the alarms to wake you, meaning you never need to worry about being woken up on the weekends, or forgetting to turn the alarm on during the week. Once you set it, you can forget it. It also features Sangeans Super Capacitor that provides memory and alarm memories for up to 1 hour during a power disruption, eliminating the need for a battery backup. For the ambitious power nappers' of the world the clock features a NAP function that can be set to wake you in 10 minute intervals up to 2 hours without re-setting the alarms so that you can get the most of your power nap. There is also a handy sleep timer that allows you to fall asleep listening to your favorite radio station from 15 minutes up to 2 hours. With the Aux-input you can connect your iPod(TM) or a CD player to enjoy your favorite Soothing Sounds CD or digital music collection to fall asleep. With all these features, it is truly the easiest and last Alarm Clock Radio you will ever have to buy.

In normal lighting conditions, you may notice slightly less sharpness and contrast, and you may also see a kind of sparkling, shimmering effect as you move your head to look at the LCD. Don't worry, that's normal - it's caused by all the little cells in the Anti Glare Expert Shield doing their job.

The D300 features a new 51-point autofocus system with Nikon's 3D Focus Tracking feature and two new LiveView shooting modes that allow users to frame a photograph using the camera's high-resolution LCD monitor. The D300 shares a similar Scene Recognition System as is found in the D3; it promises to greatly enhance the accuracy of autofocus, autoexposure, and auto white balance by recognizing the subject or scene being photographed and applying this information to the calculations for the three functions.\", 'The D300 reacts with lightning speed, powering up in a mere 0.13 seconds and shooting with an imperceptible 45-millisecond shutter release lag time. The D300 is capable of shooting at a rapid six frames per second and can go as fast as eight frames per second when using the optional MB-D10 multi-power battery pack. In continuous bursts, the D300 can shoot up to 100 shots at full 12.3-megapixel resolution.

Its new Scene Recognition System advances the use of Nikon's acclaimed 1,005-segment sensor to recognize colors and light patterns that help the camera determine the subject and the type of scene being photographed before a picture is taken. This information is used to improve the accuracy of autofocus, autoexposure, and auto white balance functions in the D300. For example, the camera can track moving subjects better and by identifying them, it can also automatically select focus points faster and with greater accuracy. It can also analyze highlights and more accurately determine exposure, as well as infer light sources to deliver more accurate white balance detection.\", \"The D300 incorporates Nikon's new Multi-CAM 3500DX autofocus module that features an intelligent array of 15 cross-type sensors and 36 horizontal sensors. These sensors can either be used individually or in groups, with the option for Single area AF mode and Dynamic AF modes using groups of either nine, 21, or all 51 focus points.

The HL 850 lets you cut flush to an adjacent surface because it can plane across the entire width of the rabbet. Because the planer head is mounted to one side, it sits flush with the opposite side of the planer housing. The retractable side guard makes planing safer, and it swings up and to the side as the rabbet depth increases. Planing up to the edge in deep rabbets is no longer a problem. For super smooth cuts with less to no re-work the HL 850 uses a spiral, single-knife cutter-head for smooth and clean cuts with less noise. On most planers with two knives, they must be set to the same height to achieve best results. This is tricky at best. The single-knife cutter-head eliminates this problem while providing a simple and easy knife change. Near total dust extraction is possible thanks to the efficient internal design and multi-position dust extraction port. Smooth cuts are also a result of MMC electronics that provide soft start for jolt-free start and constant speed under load for consistent cutting results without bogging down. Precision depth control is simple and allows for adjustment to 1/256 inch (1/10 mm) by turning the forward rotary handle. The positive lock mechanism ensures that the bed is locked firmly for precise, repeatable results. The HL 850 can also accept accessory Festool cutter-heads to create textured \"rustic\" effects in architectural pieces and flooring for a unique look in the fraction of the time of laborious hand work. Convert the HL 850 into a stable and robust bench-top jointer with Festool accessory support stand and angle stop fence unit. The bed of the HL 850 is long and makes it ideal for planing and scribing doors, filler strips, and cabinet to fit.

Thanks to two quartz precision oscillators used on M2Tech hiFace DAC, clock source for internal interface to the conversion IC features a very low jitter. Low jitter produces a very limited sound image distortion and degradation. Phase noise (main responsible for jitter) is also very low: this guarantees a short and long range clock stability, also reinforced by a board supply voltage regulation (e.g. at environmental temperature stability is 2-5ppm approximately, compared to 50-100ppm performed by oscillators normally used on commercial CD players).', 'USB 2.0 AUDIO  No need for custom driver. Using the hiFace DAC is very easy. Just connect it to your Mac, iPad or Linux computer and it will be immediately visible in the devices list and ready to use. A driver is still necessary for Windows computers, which enables for DS, KS, WASAPI and ASIO mode.', \" SIZE, EASE OF USE AND VERY HIGH  M2Tech hiFace DAC features a very compact size and can be directly (or using an accessory USB A-A adapter, not supplied with hiFace) connected to a High Speed USB 2.0 port of any computer or tablet. A 3.5mm stereo jack socket provides an output stereo line-level signal, ready to be connected to a Hi-End system. No external power supply is required, as hiFace DAC draws its power from USB bus itself and regulates it with its internal regulators. hiFace DAC connected to a last generation mini PC provided with a High Speed USB port makes for a complete digital music source at very low prices (in the range of few hundreds Euros). Such system allows for listening any density and resolution music files (up to 384/32!), playing own CD's using a CD ROM drive, obtaining access to more than 10,000 web radio, many of which broadcast their transmissions with CD quality.\"]\n{\"Product Dimensions\": \"5.3 x 4.2 x 1.8 inches\", \"Item Weight\": \"3.2 ounces\", \"Manufacturer\": \"Smile Lanna Gadget\", \"Date First Available\": \"May 8, 2013\"}"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}

Chevrolet/GMC Ride-Rite air springs work to maximize your vehicle's safe load-carrying capacity, stability, ride quality, and brake effectiveness. How does Ride-Rite technology work? Chevrolet/GMC Ride-Rite air springs, also called Ride-Rite air bags, install between the frame and suspension. They use two convoluted air springs that can be individually tweaked to accommodate dynamic loads. Inflate or deflate your vehicle's air springs and see how they help enhance your ride by absorbing road vibrations and lessening interleaf friction. It'll feel like the road is a cushion of air. They could help other parts of your Chevrolet/GMC last longer and perform better, too. Ride-Rite air helper springs stop leaf springs from permanent sagging under constant load and lower your chances of bottoming out by softening contact between the frame and axle. Chevrolet/GMC Ride-Rite kits come with the pieces and parts you need for easy installation, including hardware, brackets, air springs, air line, and separate valves for manual inflation. Most customers complete their installation in under two hours. No-drill kits take half the time. Additional Chevrolet/GMC air accessories, like controls and air tanks, can be purchased separately. Why buy Firestone air bags? Firestone released the first pneumatic suspension device in the 1930s. Since then, Firestone has risen to be one of the leading manufacturers of commercial air springs. Our air springs are precision engineered with expertise from millions of commercial vehicle miles and built from commercial-grade steel plates with rolled crimp design. Every product goes through robust, comprehensive testing to deliver results you can bank on load after load.

The radiator contains a series of small tubes through which coolant flows from the engine. A network of fins surrounds the tubes. Airflow through the grille when the vehicle is at speed, or drawn though by the fan when the vehicle is idling or at low speed, flows through the radiator. Heat is transferred from the coolant to the fins and to the cooler ambient air. If testing proves that your radiator is leaking, clogged, or otherwise damaged, don''t pay the high dealer price for a replacement, when you can get an quality radiator for much less from Replace. The most common reason for radiator replacement is coolant leakage, but a radiator can also fail because it is clogged or the cooling fins are damaged. Leaks that aren''t obvious can be detected with a pressure tester. Deposit buildup, usually caused by not changing the coolant at regular intervals, can clog coolant passages and reduce coolant flow. Debris buildup in the fins and fins that are bent over from impact will reduce airflow through the radiator. Any of these defects can cause reduced cooling system efficiency and engine overheating. In the past if you needed a radiator you had to pay for an expensive replacement from the dealer. Today you can fix your car or truck properly and have money left in your pocket with a quality replacement radiator from Replace. Replace offers quality radiators at less than original equipment prices. You get the same quality part that you''d get at the dealer without the high dealer price. A Replace radiator will look, fit and function just like a radiator from the dealer, so the cooling system in your car or truck will perform properly. Replace radiators are designed using the latest software so they exactly replicate the units, then they''re man\"]\n['Please Review Vehicle Fitment Notes, In The Product Description Below, Before Purchasing', 'Same quality as for less money', 'Designed with the latest software and manufactured with modern tooling', 'Direct replacement', 'Installs the same as factory unit']\n{\"Manufacturer\": \"Sawyer Auto\", \"Brand\": \"Sawyer Auto\", \"Exterior\": \"Ready To Paint\", \"Manufacturer Part Number\": \"\", \"Date First Available\": \"March 16, 2019\"}"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}
