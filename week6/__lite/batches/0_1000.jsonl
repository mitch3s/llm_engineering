Combining this lens with the 25 mm provides double the magnification, or the equivalent of a 12.5 mm eyepiece, while the 10 mm gives you the power of a 5 mm eyepiece. Eye relief is the distance your eye has to be from the first lens in the eyepiece in order to see the full field of view.

This is a good thing, because normally the shorter the focal length of the eyepiece, the less eye relief you have. In other words, a standard 10mm eyepiece, as a general rule, will have better eye relief than a 5mm eyepiece. Bonus! The Celestron Omni 2x Barlow comes in a sleek, silver package.

Zilcan factory in Istanbul. At the age of nine Mehmet Tamde\u011fer started to work for Mikhail Zilcan. Mikhail Zilcan and Kirkor K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fckyan taught him every aspect of this ancient Turkish art, based on a history that stems back to the early 17th century. The Istanbul brand name was adopted by a cymbal works established by two cymbal smiths, Mehmet Tamdeger and Agop Tomurcuk. At that time, they had over three decades of cymbal making experience. Mehmet and Agop named their company after the city that has been home to the epitome of high quality cymbals for many, many years: Istanbul. These cymbals were first exported to the U.S. in 1984, first under the name \"Zildjiler\", and soon afterwards as \"Istanbul\". Both craftsmen signed each cymbal and many of these cymbals are now collectors\\' items. After Agop Tomurcuk\\'s unexpected death in July 1996, Mehmet decided to continue the production of cymbals under his own name, \u0130stanbul Mehmet. A lot has changed since then, but his belief in the richness and the character of a handmade cymbal will always remain. Machines don\\'t have ears. That\\'s why we continue to make our cymbals according to the ancient tradition - with an open eye towards the music that\\'s being made now, and in the future.']\n['Hand crafted in Istanbul, Turkey', 'Fairly Complex Mix, Strong Ping over Washy Dark Overtone', 'Special Buffed Finish with Unlathed Bell and Strip on the Edge', 'The Sultan Series Younger Brother', 'Available in 20\", 21\", 22\"']\n{\"Item Weight\": \"3.99 pounds\", \"Product Dimensions\": \"21 x 21 x 1 inches\", \"Country of Origin\": \"Turkey\", \"Is Discontinued By Manufacturer\": \"No\", \"Date First Available\": \"April 1, 2014\", \"Size\": \"-inch\", \"Brand\": \"Istanbul Mehmet Cymbals\", \"Model Name\": \"OH-R21\", \"Item Dimensions LxWxH\": \"21 x 21 x 1 inches\", \"Included Components\": \"Cymbal\"}"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}

The Lord Mayor has failed to act and it is down to these mighty men to lead trained bands of militia to fight the fire and save the city. To do so they must decide which districts to sacrifice to the fire and which to protect. Remember, these same men own much of London, thus such choices will shape their own future and greatly affect their wealth and standing. Use the trained bands to suppress the fire and explosives to destroy blocks of housing to create fire breaks and prevent its spread. Do you choose to protect your own homes, turning a blind eye and allowing the fire to consume your rival's property? Or will you stand as the hero of London, and choose to save as much of the city as possible? Victory can belong to the player with the most property left after the ashes settle, but stopping the fire and saving London's most famous landmarks may win a more altruistic land owner the hearts and minds of the people.\"]\n{\"Package Dimensions\": \"13.2 x 10.5 x 2.5 inches\", \"Item Weight\": \"2 pounds\", \"Manufacturer recommended age\": \"12 years and up\", \"Is Discontinued By Manufacturer\": \"No\", \"Manufacturer\": \"Medusa Games\"}"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}

This magnifier enhances the size and resolution of an object or image, and is commonly used for a variety of applications such as jewelry-making, watch-making, needlework, artwork, electronic inspection, fly-tying, book-reading, print inspection, and stamp-collecting.', 'The clip-on, binocular, lightweight (0.417 lbs) magnifier features binocular lenses that come with a frame and clip that attaches to the frame or eyeglasses. The magnifier can be worn over prescription or safety eyeglasses, and has the ability to flip up when not in use. Spring-loaded pivot screws hold the headband in a raised or a forward-facing position. The magnifier is available in assorted colors such as black, and blue. It comes housed in a protective shell and carrying case. It has a one-year limited warranty.', 'Diopter (D) is a technical term for the measurement of the light curvature and thickness of a lens. A dioptric number and a magnification number are not the same thing. Diopter strength represents a specific magnification power (X). For example, a 5-diopter provides 2.5X magnification (at a distance of 8\u201d). The higher the diopter, the more magnification a lens can provide. As magnification increases, distance to the object (focal length), and field of view (diameter, or narrowness of view) decrease. Magnifiers and prescription eyeglasses have a diopter value, such as 1.5 or 2. The dioptric strength of an accessory lens, such as prescription eyeglasses or an eye loupe, must be added to the dioptric strength of the magnifier to calculate total magnification.', 'Magnifiers are devices used to enlarge the visual appearance of an object or image. Magnifiers come in a variety of styles such as hand-held, headband, standing, clip-on, eye loupe, and those that hang in a necklace form, or fit in a trouser pocket. Magnifiers are commonly made of plastic or glass. They can have one or more lenses with varying magnification abilities, and can have a binocular configuration with a single lens, or two separate lenses. They are sometimes used with LED or fluorescent light sources to help control viewing capabilities. Magnifier ability is often expressed as magnification at a specific length. For example, 1.75X at 14\u201d means that when a magnifier is held at 14\u201d from a viewer\u2019s eyes, the object will be magnified 1.75 times (X) its actual size. As magnification increases, viewing areas and focal length decrease. Magnifiers sometimes have a diopter number, expressed as + or - D, which is a measurement of strength (or power) of the lens. Some magnifiers are marked with a dioptric number on the lens. A high diopter number has a higher\n['Eyeglass clip-on binocular visor with 1.75X magnifying lens plate for hands-free viewing', 'Ground and polished glass prismatic lens for improved focus and reduced eye strain', 'Clips on to eyeglasses or to included eyeglass frame', 'Lens plate tilts out of way when not needed', '14\" focal length for a variety of uses']\n{\"Is Discontinued By Manufacturer\": \"No\", \"Date First Available\": \"December 17, 2004\", \"Manufacturer\": \"Donegan Optical\"}"}], "reasoning_effort": "low"}}

Aluminum construction also makes the box highly resistant to corrosion for long-lasting use. To add even more strength to the crossover truck tool box, the lid features our patented RigidCore foam-filled design. Layered between two sheets of aluminum, this core greatly increases the structural integrity of the lid to prevent bending and warping and to ensure smooth opening and closing. The lid is able to open to a full 90 degrees, providing better access to tools, equipment and other stored items. It also features self-opening struts to make it easy to open the box when your hands are full. This particular truck tool box features a low profile, meaning the lid is built lower than our standard lid. This provides a better view out the rear cab window and additional clearance for other items in the truck bed, if needed. To keep out moisture, dirt and even insects, the lid is also fitted with a MicroSeal gasket that seals off the inside of the tool box from the outside elements. UWS crossover truck tool boxes make it easy to keep your tools and other items organized, featuring built-in screwdriver holders and a three-compartment sliding tool tray.

A lot can happen to a vehicle in that much time. And, if you\u2019re like many 6.4L Powerstroke owners, your degas tank is looking worse for wear. Over time, the stock plastic tank becomes brittle and cloudy, making it prone to leaks and impossible to see the coolant level. Luckily, Mishimoto has a solution that will look and function in 15 years just as well as it does today. Replace your ugly and brittle plastic stock tank with Mishimoto\u2019s all-aluminum 2008-2010 Ford 6.4L Powerstroke degas tank. The fully-welded design of Mishimoto\u2019s degas tank means that it won\u2019t crack and leak coolant, and the integrated sight tube makes checking the coolant level easy. No more trying to shine a flashlight through a muddy tank. For even more convenience, the Mishimoto degas tank includes an additional 1/8\u201d NPT port for easy pressure monitoring. The Mishimoto 6.4L Powerstroke Aluminum Degas Tank is available in a stealthy micro-wrinkle black powdercoat or natural finish* to match any custom theme. Of course, this degas tank is also backed by Mishimoto's Lifetime Warranty.

A brand new stainless steel eGrille is the answer! This custom grille insert is easy to install and will upgrade your car or truck's appearance within minutes. Made from grade 304 stainless steel, the black eGrille stays painted and looking great much longer than aluminum grilles. The eGrille is the only grill that is powder coated black on all 4 sides, giving the eGrille 360 degree coverage. Attention to detail is another winning factor - meaning the eGrille is beautifully finished front and back. Heavy duty rivet bolts exert uniform clamping along the back of the eGrille, ensuring that not a whistle will be heard as you speed along the highway. A dreadful whistling noise is reportedly common in other brands of grilles. This is caused by poor welding techniques and the wind passing through the crevices. Choose the black eGrille for superior craftsmanship and a one of a kind look.Specification*Position: Main Upper + Lower Bumper*Material: 304 Stainless Steel*Finish: Black Powder CoatedInstallation2 pcs Replacement (Cutting And Drilling Not Required) Item offeredBillet Grille InsertAll Necessary Mounting HardwaresInstallation InstructionNoteGrille insert only, logo or emblem, frame or shell is NOT included.\"]\n['\u3010CUSTOM FIT\u3011Compatible with Nissan Maxima 2009-2014', '\u3010 DESIGN\u3011Premium stainless steel billets with black powder coated surface guaranteed to last.

Time. Time to mess with all the technical stuff.But creativity needs boundaries. In an unlimited space there is no need to be creative, as all destinations can be reached with just some knowledge and craftsmanship.The ALVA designers decided to try another way: Sensible downsizing.The Nanoface is designed as partner of modern digital audio workstations. There are no software option dialogs or an integrated mixer. Just a high-speed driver. All modern audio programs provide a low latency engine, an integrated mixer with plug-in support and monitoring features. They emulate a complete studio workflow. Some audio interfaces try to do the same and thus doubling not only the features, but also the time to mess with them.The Nanoface is different. All features can be controlled with ONE multi controller. Directly on the unit. In combination with an audio sequencer this is what most all musicians need. No more. No less. If you want to use a mixer, with sends, busses and effects it s already in your DAW software.Analog I/OsThe Nanoface provides 6 audio I/Os enough for a small home studio, a DJ- or surround setup. A MIDI input and two MIDI outputs form a perfect combination to connect a keyboard and external synthesizers or samplers. Four analog inputs two of them equipped with high-quality mic preamps - allow the simultaneously recording of different sources at the same time, like a microphone, an electric guitar and a synthesizer. Four analog outputs provide a flexible setup for monitoring two stereo signals at the same time, e. g. with main speakers and headphones. The signal from output 1/2 can be routed to output 3/4 and individually adjusted. Digital I/OThe digital I/O works in standard SPDIF format.

The microphone features three switchable polar patterns including cardioid, bidirectional, and omnidirectional. In addition, the MK300 employs a high-pass filter at 100Hz and -10dB pad for recording loud sound sources.The frequency response boasts a full bottom end and a crystal clear top end, yet at the same time, the midrange is honest and open. The microphone produces amazing results when recording acoustic instruments, guitar amps, or as overheads on a drum kit. But of course, the MK300 really excels on vocal applications. The MK300 utilizes a new custom Miktek capsule developed by Miktek engineers, featuring dual 1-inch diaphragms made using 5-micron Mylar with a 0.4-micron layer of evaporated gold.
